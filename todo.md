# Issues

* We could currently duplicate a question in the store and then have one of the "wrong" answers be a correct answer.

* At the moment saying that a question is "KorToEng" is saying that it has a
  korean field and an english field, but we can still be given the english as
  the prompt.
  

# New Features

* Focus on the words you got wrong. Do them 4 times over. Maybe include an "unsure" button to ensure a word/phrase is definitely revised in that round.
