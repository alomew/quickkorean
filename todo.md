# Issues

- [ ] We could currently duplicate a question in the store and then have one of the "wrong" answers be a correct answer.
- [ ] Looks pretty naff on phones
- [ ] If you spam "Unsure", it increases progress counter, even though no questions are being 
passed until NeedNewQuestion is fired. Button should be deactivated
if answer already given; progress should get added when NeedNewQuestion fired.
- [ ] Should work with back button -- i.e. use Navigation

# New Features

- [x] Focus on the words you got wrong. Do them 4 times over. Maybe include an "unsure" button to ensure a word/phrase is definitely revised in that round.
- [x] Increase the focus on these unknown words 
  - [x] Remind user of the translations
  - [x] Make them get it right multiple times.
- [ ] Include the words they will be tested on on front page
